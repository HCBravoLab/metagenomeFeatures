Description: metagenomeFeatures was developed for use in exploring
    the taxonomic annotations for a marker-gene metagenomic sequence
    dataset. The package can be used to explore the taxonomic
    composition of a marker-gene database or annotated sequences from
    marker-gene metagenome experiment.
