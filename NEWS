version 1.99.9 (last updated 2018-04-02)
    + This version is in prepration for the version 2.0
    + The MgDb-class definition was been redefined.
        + To reduce memory usage the and sequence data is now stored
in the SQLite file along with the taxonomy data.
    + The mgFeatures-class now extends the DataFrame-class instead of the AnnotatedDataFrame-class so that mgFeatures can be used to define the rowData slot in a summarizedExperiment-class object.
    + The vignettes have been revised and new vignettes were added providing examples for working with the new class definitions.
    + Along with the new class definitions we have annotation packages for the three major 16S rRNA databases, SILVA, RDP, and Greengenes.
    + Greengenes version 13.8 97% similarity OTUs database is now included in the package.

version 1.6.0 (last update 2017-04-14)
    + Bioc release cleaned up documentation and debugging MgDb class definition with tree slot

version 1.5.1 (last update 2017-03-20)
    + editing documentation

version 1.1.3 (2016-10-01)
    + replaced msd16S with mock community dataset for examples
    + changed tree mgFeatures and MgDb slot from class phylo to phyloOrNULL

version 1.1.2: (2016-03-26)
    + Added mgFeatures class - this class replaces metagenomeAnnotation in the 16S workflow, and contains database information for a user provided list of database sequence ids. A new metagenomeAnnotation-class will be added to the package when a suitable R native 16S taxonomic classificaiton method is available.
    + new `aggregate_taxa` function for aggregating MRexperiment objects to user defined taxonomic level, aggretation of count data is performed using sums by dafault, users can pass any column wise matrix operation.

version 0.0.0.9 : (2015-09-14)
	+ Pre-Release Bioconductor
