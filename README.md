metagenomeFeatures is an R package with annotating 16S metagenomic sequence data using the metagenomeFeatures package (https://github.com/HCBravoLab/metagenomeFeatures.git). A package for the greengenes database version 13.5 was developed, `greengenes13.5MgDb`(https://github.com/HCBravoLab/greengenes13.5MgDb), for annotating 16S datasets using metagenomeFeatures.    

The package is still in development and not available from bioconductor.

To install the development version of the package
* this can be done using devtools `install_github("HCBravoLab/metagenomeFeatures")`  

See the `greengenes13.5MgDb` github repository for installation instructions

The package has vignettes demonstrating how to use the greenegenes13.5MgDb package to annotate 16S metagenomic sequence data.
