metagenomeFeatures is an R package with annotating 16S metagenomic sequence data using the metagenomeFeatures package (https://github.com/HCBravoLab/metagenomeFeatures.git). A package for the greengenes database version 13.5 was developed, `greengenes13.5MgDb`(https://github.com/HCBravoLab/greengenes13.5MgDb), for annotating 16S datasets using metagenomeFeatures.    
This package is available on Bioconductor, https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/metagenomeFeatures.html. 

We are working on version 2.0, which includes significant updates to the MgDb and mgFeatures class definitions. 

To install the development version of the package
* this can be done using devtools `install_github("HCBravoLab/metagenomeFeatures")`  

See the `greengenes13.5MgDb` github repository, https://github.com/HCBravoLab/greengenes13.5MgDb, for instructions to instal the development version of the annotation package. 

The package has vignettes demonstrating how to use the greenegenes13.5MgDb package to annotate 16S metagenomic sequence data.
