(2008). The fungal community was analyzed using an identical approach, except that we substituted a primer set adapted for pyrosequencing as described by Borneman and Hartin (2000). The forward primer consists of the 454 adapter B, a 2-bp linker sequence (AG) and the 817f 18S rRNA-specific primer (5 -TTAGCATGGAATAATRRAATAGGA-3 ). The reverse primer consists of the 454 adapter A, a 12-bp barcode, a 2-bp linker sequence (AC) and the 1196r primer (5 -TCTGGACCTGGTGAGTTTCC-3 ). This primer set was selected because it has been shown to be fungal-specific and targets a region of the 18S rRNA gene, which is variable between major taxa and can be aligned (permitting phylogenetic analyses such as UniFrac). However, it should be noted that this gene region is not sufficiently variable to permit detailed taxonomic identification of fungal communities and thus community analyses are restricted to the family level or above.
